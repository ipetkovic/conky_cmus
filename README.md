Now playing cmus add-on for conky

This conky script is inspired by https://github.com/YakBarber/Conky-CMUS and https://github.com/mpersano/conky-circles-dark-blue.

It was hard to find something useful regarding cmus player and conky.
I found Conky-CMUS but it did not provide all the functionality I need. Therefore, I created my own version of now playing cmus addon for conky. Style is inspired by https://github.com/mpersano/conky-circles-dark-blue.
